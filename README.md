# Detecting and Mitigating Malicious Manipulations in Satellite Imagery 

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Master's thesis on utilizing watermarking to detect and mitigate malicious manipulations in satellite imagery.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### `01_code/`
Contains all the scripts and code modules required for watermark embedding, manipulation detection, and other image processing tasks.

### `02_data/`
<<<<<<< HEAD
Here is the link to download the data yourself: https://zenodo.org/records/7711810#.ZAm3k-zMKEA
Ensure you download the Mulit-Spectrum version.

### `03_results/`
Stores the raw output from the experiments, including detection accuracy metrics, logs, and intermediate data for analysis.

### `04_graphs/`
Houses all visual outputs, such as plots and graphs, illustrating the effectiveness of watermarking and manipulation detection methodologies.

## Usage

To replicate the experiments or apply the watermarking techniques, navigate to the `01_code/` directory and  run the Jupyter notebook.

## Visualizations

Graphical illustrations of results can be found under `04_graphs/`. They provide a visual understanding of the methods' performance.
